Implement a ArrayUtil DataType and methods around it.

A)  The ArrayUtil contains 
1->base, which is a pointer to the array
2->typeSize,  which is size of one array element
3->length, which is how many elements are there.

To use the array you just have to cast the base to the pointer of the respective type: like int* a,
float* a ,etc and then a[5] will give you the fifth int or float

B)  int areEqual(ArrayUtil a, ArrayUtil b)
1->will compare a with b and return 1 if both are equal, if not it returns 0 

C)  ArrayUtil create(int typeSize, int length) 
1->will create an array and wrap it with the ArrayUtil and return it.
2->the array contents will all be set to zero or its equivalent value.

D)  ArrayUtil resize(ArrayUtil util, int length) 
1->will resize the array and return the modified ArrayUtil. 
2->the array contents should be trimmed if new size is less and copied over if the new size is more.
